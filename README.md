# https://jacobbradleykenyon.shinyapps.io/TwitMine/

Twitter mining application using RStudio and shinyR.  If one wishes to run this application on their local machine they will need to obtain the proper twitter credentials (Access Token, Access Secret, Consumer Key & Consumer Secret) using a twitter account.  If you do not have a twitter account you can follow the link above to a working example.

The backend code illustrates how to extract and manipulate text such that a word cloud can be created along with a data table consisting of snippets of all the tweets that contain the keywords.

The code illustrates how to customize the UI in shinyR using css script within the HTML function, create multiple tab pages within the app, and how create a reactive environment among other things.
