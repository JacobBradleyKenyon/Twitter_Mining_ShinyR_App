# Twitter_Mining_ShinyR_App

Twitter mining application using RStudio and shinyR.  If one wishes to run this application on a local machine you will need to obtain the Access token to Twitter (Access Token, Access Secret, Consumer Key & Consumer Secret) using a twitter account.  Simply paste twitter credentials into the code, ensure that "app.R" and "www" folder are in the same directory, then run the code. 

If you do not have a twitter account you can follow the link below to a working example.
